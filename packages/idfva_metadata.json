  "summary": "This model generates investigation polygons which are used to estimate and store incremental erosion and deposition volumes along the path of a debris flow at user- defined resolution. The user will need: 1) a .LAS or .TIF of topographic change, 2) a DEM of the AOI, and 3) a shapefile (polyline) of the debris flow path of interest. Each incremental volume is georeferenced and stored within a shapefile attribute associated with a catchment area and distance from outlet for analysis.",
