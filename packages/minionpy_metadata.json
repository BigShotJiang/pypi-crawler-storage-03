The use of this library in \n        Minion follows the same licensing terms, which allow for free usage, modification, \n        and distribution, provided that the copyright notice and license are included.\n        \n        For more information about the `LBFGSpp` library, please refer to its official repository.\n        \n        \n        Modified Code from Suganthan GitHub Repository\n        ---------------------------------------------\n        \n        Some algorithms (NL-SHADE-RSP, j2020, LSRTDE) implemented in the Minion library \n        and all the CEC benchmark problems are based on the original code published by \n        Suganthan on GitHub (https://github.com/P-N-Suganthan). This code has been modified \n        to fit the Minion API. However, the original GitHub repository does not include a license file, \n        and as such, the licensing terms for the original code are not explicitly defined.\n        \n        Since the code was publicly available on GitHub, we assume it is available for use in accordance \n        with the standard practices for open-source code. If the original author has any licensing terms \n        that we are unaware of, we are open to discussions and will take the necessary steps \n        to comply with any applicable requirements.\n        \n        If you are concerned about the licensing of this code, \n        we recommend contacting the author or repository owner directly for clarification.\n        ",
