  "name": "FunctionEncoder",
  "version": "0.2.0",
  "summary": "A package for learning basis functions over arbitrary function sets. This allows even high-dimensional problems to be solved via a minimal number of basis functions. This allows for zero-shot transfer within these spaces, and also a mechanism for fully informative function representation via the coefficients of the basis functions. Hilbert spaces are nifty.",
